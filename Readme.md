I have abandoned this game because I don't like the story too much. I am now reusing all the systems I made for this game in [Fist of Ardor](https://github.com/ArjhanToteck/Fist-of-Ardor).

# Plot
The player is a member of an underground organization in the city of Castelon simply called “The Syndicate,” led by a mysterious figure referred to only as “The Director.” In the beginning, the player carries out jobs for the syndicate for money, which are given to him by a contact named Agostýn.

Eventually, a job comes with a very high risk, but very high reward: they must protect a large unknown “shipment” from Castelon to Zakarra. For this job, Agostýn goes too.

The player discovers the main roads are heavily guarded, so they must take a detour through the Sylva Nerra, a small section of The Unconquerable, a region of rain forests full of dangerous natives.

The party is attacked by a group of native bandits. The “shipment” is stolen and everyone is killed, save for Agostýn and the player. Agostýn reveals that apparently, the package they had been moving was a powerful magical weapon with the capability to destroy entire cities. The player asks what kind of weapon, but nobody knows except for The Director and his contact in Zakarra.

In search for the stolen weapon, they encounter a native called Aketzali who decides to help them out, in fear that the weapon might destroy his home. He leads them to his home city of Teochantli.

After a few side quests there, they eventually track and find the bandits who stole the weapon. After a long fight throughout their base in an abandoned temple, they find the mysterious weapon’s container empty.

When they return to Teochantli, the city is a completely different place. Everyone in the city is possessed by some sort of parasitic hivemind. Apparently, this bio-weapon was the secret package, and now it’s loose.

The player must kill off the infected natives before finding the final boss: a strange monster who controls the hivemind.

The credits roll.

In a post-credit scene, Agostýn informs the director, a man in a white cloak with a steel mask, about his and the player’s misadventure.

“I am disappointed, but I am also sure our contact in Zakarra will understand. As for [player name]... I am pleased with the way he controlled the situation. Perhaps it is time we met.”
